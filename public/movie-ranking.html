<h1>The Best Movies According to Javan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Parasite</h3>
   <p>Great story telling that captures the harsh truth of different social classes and how they interact with one another.</p>

<h3>WALL-E</h3>
   <p>A childhood favourite of mine.</p>

<h3>The Lord of the Ring</h3>
   <p>I'm cheating a bit here, but the whole trilogy deserves the spot. Maybe I might as well add The Hobbit trilogy.</p>
